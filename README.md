About Me
👋 Hello! I’m Balram, the creator of this sleek cyberpunk-inspired portfolio website.

✨ This site features a dynamic username with floating sparkles, a cool background video, smooth animations, and a simple music player that plays your favorite tracks automatically.

🎨 Everything is fully customizable by editing the config object inside the single index.html file - change your name, tagline, social links, music files, and icons easily!

🎵 Just drop your music files into the assets/music/ folder and icons into assets/icons/ for a personalized experience.

📊 The visitor count is stored locally for simplicity, so you can track visits without complex backend setups.
